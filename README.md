Most of my time is spent on root modules (e.g. [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk), [KernelSU](https://kernelsu.org), [Apatch](https://github.com/bmax121/APatch)) while also writing small applications.
Flash phone is one of my great pleasures, and I also love anime and games.
Right now, I'm mainly passionate about the [ウマ娘](https://umamusume.jp) anime and on the game (I've watched all of the [ウマ娘](https://umamusume.jp) anime (including the extras), and I've been playing the game as well).
I also play some games like [Arknights](https://www.arknights.jp), the [少女前線](https://sunborngame.com/index) series, and the [崩壊](https://www.hoyoverse.com) series.
Just a common developer that expects attention from others.
